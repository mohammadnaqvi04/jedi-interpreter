### Jedi is an experimental language written in Scala that supports features of modern programming languages

- Lambdas, closures, and static scoping
- Eager and lazy execution
- Blocks
- Variables
- Objects
- Dynamic type checking


#### Jedi's read-execute-print loop (REPL) repeatedly:

1. Reads an expression string entered by the user,
2. Parses it into an expression object,
3. Executes the object,
4. Then prints the resulting value.
